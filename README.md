# Portfolio project

A portfolio I made for myself during Technigo frontend boot camp.

## What did I do?

In this project I was given a design to replicate as closely as possible. I coded the portfolio mobile first and tested the accessibility of the page with NVDA.

This project was made with CSS and HTML only. I used flexbox and grid for the layout.
